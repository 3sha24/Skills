      <p><blockquote><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Skills are the cornerstone of personal development, representing the learned capacities to perform actions proficiently
<sup><b>1</b></sup>. Acquiring and refining skills is not merely an option but a necessity in today’s dynamic world<sup><b>2</b></sup>. By investing in skill development, we the individuals empower ourselves to navigate new challenges, seize more opportunities and make meaningful contributions to society<sup><b>3</b></sup>. Like how I manage to adapt to any situation. Just like what I’ve mentioned in my Biography<sup><b>4</b></sup>. That I choose to study here in Manila, leaving them, my family, my boyfriend and my friends<sup><b>5</b></sup>. It is so hard to be separated from them because I know that I can’t handle it physically and emotionally <sup><b>6</b></sup>. Two weeks after school started, I felt a lump in my throat and I felt homesick. Like I’ve been so lonely in my life. But the thought comes into my mind that I need to be brave and I know I can do this<sup><b>7</b></sup>. That’s when I started adapting to the surroundings<sup><b>8</b></sup>.  I need to survive here in Manila to know what I will do and change what I need to<sup><b>9</b></sup>. Adapting is one thing I have in my skills<sup><b>10</b></sup>. At first, I was so shocked about the surroundings but eventually I have adjusted now<sup><b>11</b></sup>. And of course, the need to communicate to other people for familiarity<sup><b>12</b></sup>. One thing I also have is having a time management which I learned this from my father<sup><b>13</b></sup>. Every time we have an outing; he always makes sure to make it on time<sup><b>14</b></sup>. My Father is not a “Filipino type” of a man that’s why I learned to be like that<sup><b>15</b></sup>. By having a time management, all my works are on schedule at the right time<sup><b>16</b></sup>. I divide my time on learning new things, watching my favorite seasons or shows and my time on a tour<sup><b>17</b></sup>. I might say that I don’t have a lot of skills but maybe I do have another but I forgot what it is<sup><b>18</b></sup>. But along the way, I make sure that I know what I’m doing and making things right<sup><b>19</b></sup>. And that is a little too short for my Skills<sup><b>20</b></sup>.

      <h2><u><i>⋆˚࿔ MY HOBBIES 𝜗𝜚˚⋆</u></i></h2>
      <p><blockquote><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do have a lot of hobbies and hobbies can reduce stress, improve mental well-being, and enhance cognitive function<sup><b>1</b></sup>. Hobbies can also foster a sense of accomplishment, boost self-esteem, and provide opportunities for social interaction and community involvement<sup><b>2</b></sup>. It can also be a source of joy and fulfillment like one of my hobbies: Reading<sup><b>3</b></sup>. I do love reading, my mother taught me how to read and write<sup><b>4</b></sup>. She gave me mini books where there are a lot of stories with pictures to be read off<sup><b>5</b></sup>. Every time I read a book, my mind wanders and imagine what I’m reading and that will make a fantasy like in my head and it is so cool<sup><b>6</b></sup>. Reading can be also a form of exercise especially on the brain where we learn new things or deeper meaning of those things<sup><b>7</b></sup>. And I could also say that writing is one of my hobbies<sup><b>8</b></sup>. When we don’t have anything to do at school, I write to past time<sup><b>9</b></sup>. I construct words, sentences and sometimes paragraphs to ease the boredom<sup><b>10</b></sup>. I also wrote a story before and it is all about me and a fantasy story one<sup><b>11</b></sup>. Dancing and exercising are also one of my hobbies, dancing and exercising can make me relax<sup><b>12</b></sup>. And it makes my body stretch all the way and the way I move is so flexible<sup><b>13</b></sup>. I sometimes combine dancing and exercising like Zumba, to ease the feeling and get the body heat up<sup><b>14</b></sup>. By doing those, it helps my mind and body to be relaxed and concentrate on the things I’m doing right now<sup><b>15</b></sup>. Oh, and also, I love playing badminton, my Tita taught me how to play that<sup><b>16</b></sup>. When I was a kid, I saw a badminton on the store and so curious what’s that so I talk to my parents that I want to know and learn that<sup><b>17</b></sup>. So, we purchase that and my Tita helps me and taught me what are the proper ways to play Badminton<sup><b>18</b></sup>. Though she is not a pro in playing badminton, she taught me decently and I play with my neighbors<sup><b>19</b></sup>. We also play basketball, soccer and volleyball before<sup><b>20</b></sup>. Watching, it also makes me relax in a way my mind is at ease<sup><b>21</b></sup>. Last but not the least, my favorite hobby is traveling<sup><b>22</b></sup>. Traveling does this to my body, I don’t know the feeling but it makes me so chill and relax<sup><b>23</b></sup>. Like legit, seeing the beauty of the nature upon us<sup><b>24</b></sup>. The Tourist spots we could sight and capture through our phones<sup><b>25</b></sup>. Nothing beats when travelling and especially when I’m with my family<sup><b>26</b></sup>. Like what I’ve mention on my biography, that’s the fun I get when travelling with them and spending time with them and with my boyfriend<sup><b>27</b></sup>.

<!--MY INTEREST-->

      <h2><u><i>⋆˚࿔ MY INTEREST 𝜗𝜚˚⋆</u></i></h2>
      <p><blockquote><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
My interest is somewhat similar to my hobbies<sup><b>1</b></sup>. Like dancing, I was participating and become one of the leaders in Folk dance<sup><b>2</b></sup>. Folk dance is a tradition or custom of a particular people wherein a type of a dance usually is an expression of a historical or contemporary culture<sup><b>3</b></sup>. The first time I dance Folk dance; I taught it was hard for me to understand the steps but later on I am enjoying it with a lot of people<sup><b>4</b></sup>. And because of Folk dance, I also gain friends there which I can relate to and we are united with the Folk dance<sup><b>5</b></sup>. It makes us unite as one and knowing and acknowledging each other like we’ve known each other for a year<sup><b>6</b></sup>. There are some cases that we argue but at the end of the day we discuss those things and make up<sup><b>7</b></sup>. I also volunteer before, even though the part of volunteering is hard I make the most of it by being positive and giving them what they need<sup><b>8</b></sup>. Because seeing the children giving them foods and shirts, it makes my heart warm<sup><b>9</b></sup>. Just by those smiles, it makes me cry and soft for them<sup><b>10</b></sup>. I also do community service before, with my friends for scholarship<sup><b>11</b></sup>. So, we list up our names and every time our Leader announce that we have to clean the Barangay, we gather our cleaning tools and get on with it<sup><b>12</b></sup>. By participating, we can lessen the burden of other people by cleaning in front of their houses<sup><b>13</b></sup>. Collecting garbage, separating them on biodegradable and non- biodegradable and plastics for reuse, reduce and recycle purposes<sup><b>14</b></sup>. I am learning Nihongo (Japanese Language) as a past time<sup><b>15</b></sup>. Because I love the shows and seasons of animation in Japan and also their voices and languages are kinda unique<sup><b>16</b></sup>. And I will not forget to include again this one: Traveling<sup><b>17</b></sup>. One of my biggest dreams is to go to Japan with my parents and my boyfriend<sup><b>18</b></sup>. Because Japan is so ahead of us, the technology is way too fast and the Tourist spots are so amazing<sup><b>19</b></sup>. The anime merchandise, the cosplayers, the cats, vending machines, the food all of it<sup><b>20</b></sup>. I would love to go there with my family and my boyfriend when the right time comes<sup><b>21</b></sup>.
